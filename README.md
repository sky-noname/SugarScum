# How it works
## Garden Scum
The Garden has two types of scums: Manul and Auto
### Manual Scum
The Manual Scum stores the export code of your last garden tick. Click on the 'Reload Tick' button as a quick way to save scum the tick, without the need to copy-paste.

### Auto Scum
The Auto Scum menu displays what seeds have a chance of growing next tick. Simply select however many seeds you want and start the auto-scum, the mod will continually reload the next tick until these seeds have spawned!

## Lump Scum
The Lump Scum menu displays what your current sugar lump type is. Here you can select what you'd like your next lump type to be, as well as what yield you want from your current lump. Even if your lump isn't ready to be harvested yet, you can still set up the auto-scum to start scumming as soon as it ripens!
